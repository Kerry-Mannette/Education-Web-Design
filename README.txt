This activity on transforming COSTAATT's current homepage to be more responsive, and improve its 
navigation for mobile and tablet users was a refreshing exercise. 
Our design uses HTML 5 semantic tags, ARIA roles and labels, 
keyboard skips that skips straight to the main section of the homepage. 
Our design presents a cleaner UI and simple navigation giving it a better UX. However, 
there are some areas need improving, such as adjusting the images 
sizes properly to increase mobile performance.
